## What This Project Is

Hostel Management System is a full-stack web application built to streamline day-to-day hostel operations for students and staff. It combines a responsive single-page frontend with a REST API backend and a SQLite database so the same platform can handle accommodation, guest visits, fee tracking, complaints, room transfers, inventory, audit logs, and data privacy workflows.

This project supports multiple roles including students, wardens, accountants, caretakers, and administrators, making it suitable for academic DBMS/full-stack demonstrations as well as small institutional hostel operations.

## Local Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or newer
- npm 9 or newer

### 1. Start the backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run seed
npm run dev
```

The API starts on `http://localhost:3000`.

### 2. Start the frontend

Open a new terminal:

```bash
cd frontend-vanilla
npm install
npm run serve
```

Open `http://localhost:5173`.

### 3. Default demo accounts

| Role | Email | Password |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Super Admin | `admin@hostel.com` | `admin123` |
| Warden | `warden@hostel.com` | `warden123` |
| Accountant | `accountant@hostel.com` | `acc123` |
| Caretaker | `caretaker@hostel.com` | `care123` |
| Student | `john@student.com` | `pass123` |

## API and Data Notes

- The frontend automatically uses `http://localhost:3000/api` when running on localhost.
- In deployed environments, the frontend defaults to `${window.location.origin}/api`.
- The backend exposes route groups for auth, users, rooms, blocks, allocations, guest requests, visitor logs, fees, payments, complaints, transfers, waitlist, inventory, audit logs, PII deletion, and uploads.
- The database layer is powered by SQLite and seeded through `backend/scripts/seed.js`.

## Deployment Guide

### A. Push this project to GitHub

If you are publishing this folder to your GitHub repository:

```bash
git init
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/Siddh-456/Hostel-Management.git
git add .
git commit -m "Add Hostel Management System project"
git push -u origin main
```

### B. Deploy the backend

The backend is a Node.js + Express application, so it can be deployed on any Node-compatible host such as a VPS, Railway, Render, or a traditional Linux server.

```bash
cd backend
npm install --production
npm run seed
npm start
```

Recommended production environment variables:

```bash
JWT_SECRET=replace-this-with-a-secure-secret
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000
DB_PATH=./data/hostel-app.db
```

For long-running production use, a host with persistent storage is the safest choice because the app stores data in SQLite database files.

### C. Deploy the frontend

The `frontend-vanilla` folder is a static site, so it can be deployed on GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or Nginx/Apache static hosting.

If the frontend and backend are served from the same domain and the API is available under `/api`, the current configuration works without changes.

If the backend is hosted on a different domain, add this script before `js/config.js` inside `frontend-vanilla/index.html`:

```html
<script>
  window.__HOSTEL_CONFIG__ = {
    API_BASE_URL: 'https://your-backend-domain.com/api'
  };
</script>
```

### D. Production process manager

On a VPS or Linux server, PM2 is a clean way to keep the backend running:

```bash
npm install -g pm2
cd backend
pm2 start server.js --name hostel-api
pm2 save
```

## Why This Project Stands Out

- Clean, framework-free frontend architecture that still feels like a structured SPA
- Real backend workflows instead of static-only UI screens
- Useful DBMS-friendly schema with room allocation, payments, complaints, and compliance logs
- Role-based flows that make the application feel like a complete campus operations product
- Ready-made screenshots and documentation assets for portfolio or academic submission use

## Repository Files Worth Mentioning

- `README.md` - project overview, screenshots, setup, and deployment
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` - deeper system design notes
- `API-CHEATSHEET.md` - endpoint quick reference
- `QUICK-START.md` - quick onboarding notes
- `tables.sql` - schema definition
- `data.sql` - sample SQL data
